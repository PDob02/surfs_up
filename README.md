### **Surf & Ice Cream Shop Analysis**
Module 9

The purpose of our analysis was to see the viability of opening a Surf & Ice Cream shop in Hawaii based on weather statistics. Our partner & prospect W. Avy is interested in running statitisics for the months of June & December as they are opposite ends of the temperature spectrum. He has been in business before and it has failed so he is extra certain to check the weather patterns since the number one goal of business is to make sales and turn a profit.

**Results:** Our results proved to be very moderate from a temperature standpoint. It may make sense that June would get the most seasonable business but it is only slightly hotter than December. 

Summary:

The three differences between June & December weather is as follows. 

First, June is hotter than December but only by a 3 degrees on average. They both retain similar volitily of around 3 degrees. This means that most of our months are viable options for opening this stand. It also did not take into account precipitation or other weather patterns that might defer potential customers. Based on tempereature alone, these months are almost equals. 

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

The only other relevant query to provide would be precipitation for June & December. This would provide rainfall or natural events that might deter customers from leaving their houses and shopping at our store. Additionally, you could search out other months like September & March to get a fuller picture of what a year in Hawaii looks like from a climate-perspective. Below we have ran precipitation for both months and December is signficantlly more of a rainy season than the summer. This is threat to the overall profit of our shop.
